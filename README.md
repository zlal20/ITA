Python implementation of the simple perceptron or also known as a single-layer neural network, is a binary classification algorithm by Frank Rosenblatt based on the neural model of Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts developed in 1943.

The idea behind this algorithm is to simulate the functioning of brain neurons. That is, the neuron receives external impulses (x) that are considered with different importance or weight (w) in an activation function (z). If the added stimulus exceeds a certain threshold (Î¸), the neuron is activated.
